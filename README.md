## 📝 Content

The repository contains **10 questions with detailed answers**, 

### 🔹 Part 1 (Q1 – Q5)
1. CNNs vs Vision Transformers (inductive biases, data requirements, interpretability, downstream tasks)  
2. DETR (architecture, strengths, limitations vs YOLO/Faster R-CNN)  
3. Semantic segmentation vs instance segmentation (U-Net, DeepLab, Mask R-CNN)  
4. Self-supervised vs weakly-supervised learning (methods, advantages, potential)  
5. Scalability challenges in real-world CV (data imbalance, domain shift, efficiency, ethics) 


### 🔹 Part 2 (Q6 – Q10)
6. Multi-task learning in CV (benefits, challenges, examples: Mask R-CNN, Panoptic FPN)  
7. Domain adaptation (importance, adversarial adaptation, feature alignment, self-training)  
8. 3D Computer Vision (multi-view geometry, depth estimation, NeRF)  
9. Generative models (GANs vs diffusion, architectures, use cases)
